#train an image classifier in Keras using a Tensorflow backend, then serve it to the browser 
#using a super simple Flask backend. We can then deploy this flask app to google cloud using a few commands. Woot!

#save() saves the weights and the model structure to a single HDF5 file. I believe it also includes things like the optimizer state. Then you can use that HDF5 file with load() to reconstruct the whole model, including weights. save_weights() only saves the weights to HDF5 and nothing else. You need extra code to reconstruct the model from a JSON file.
